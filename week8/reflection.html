    <h1>Reflection Assignment</h1>
    <p>Javascript makes responsive design easier. Javascript helps makes web pages dynamic and interactive. An example could be when making a todo list on a web page and being able to add whatever input you would like and it being added to a collaborative list, also being able to delete the entry.Some of the things made easier by learning DOM was the different methods that allow you to get and manipulate only the element that you want, like getElementBYId(). being able to add thngs like buttons and make an alert. Some of the things I found difficult was adding event listeners and append child. I struggled with realizing how i was able to return properties like elements. My biggest accomplishment of this course was the group project. My team members lived in different time zones and we all had different scheldules and we were still able to work together and get it done. </p>
